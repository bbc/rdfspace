Right now, it will never count things one edge away as similar. They need
to have some other paths between them.
This is due to the way the adjacency matrix is computed. 
If you have a graph { 0 <-> 1 }, then the adjacency matrix is ((0, 1), (1, 0).
Therefore 0 and 1 have nothing in common.
Making the adjacency matrix A such that A[i, i] = 1 would change that behavior.
